## 💡 Business Recommendations

### 🔹 Optimize Product Inventory

Improve profitability and reduce storage costs by optimizing inventory levels for high-demand and high-margin products. Analyze demand patterns to prevent stockouts during peak periods while minimizing excess inventory during low-demand phases.

---

### 🔹 Reorganize Inventory Distribution

Some departments show high demand but insufficient inventory, leading to lost sales opportunities. Redistributing inventory across warehouses can reduce shipment delays and improve order fulfillment for high-demand products.

---

### 🔹 Improve Marketing Strategies

Focus marketing efforts on products with the highest profit margins. Targeted promotions and seasonal discounts can boost sales and improve customer engagement while maximizing revenue.

---

### 🔹 Monitor & Reduce Shipment Delays

Further investigation is required to identify the root causes of shipment delays. Addressing logistical bottlenecks and optimizing shipping processes can significantly improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
